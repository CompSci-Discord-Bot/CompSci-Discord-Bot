Student Ratings for William Sverdlik:

"I think Bill is great when you dont just totally piss him off"

"Bill basically expected you to read something once and it's immediately downloaded to your brain, never to be forgotten. That's how he teaches"

"Bill is extremely intelligent and a super fun guy to be around. However, he gets very testy if people don't participate in class as much as he wants. For example, if there's ever more than a few seconds of silence after he asks the class a question (which often happens, as students need time to process the material), expect to be lightly mocked for not being inquisitive enough and made to feel like you're not grasping the material well. Additionally, he likes to trap students on quizzes and tests with \"trick\" questions, which is exacerbated by the fact that he is an extremely unforgiving grader. That said, some students might consider these things a plus, as Bill's intense teaching style forces you to keep on your toes and learn important topics the best you can."

"Bill is a really chill dude. He is very social and wants to have an interactive environment in the class. He teaches stuff really well as well. However, he is a harsh grader when it comes to quizzes and programs. He marks you down for really tiny things. So, if you want to have all areas covered, you need to be extremely precise. He has his own youtube videos on canvas as well and they are really helpful as well."
