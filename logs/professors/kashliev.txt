Student Ratings for Andrew Kashliev:

"This professor is consistently late to class, and literally reads off the slides for the entire lecture.  He then assigns in class assignments or in class \"quizzes\" as he calls them that are over the material that he literally taught you in that lecture.  Not really a fan of his teaching style myself."

"Kashliev's main method of teaching is reading off of prepared PowerPoint slides. Lectures feel as if someone is unexcitedly reciting a textbook at you. He tries to gloss over numerous important topics in each lecture, when he should be dedicating entire lectures to each topic. This would not be a huge issue if he gave us regular homework so we could practice these concepts. He also just doesn't seem to have any interest in teaching. He starts lectures late, returns from 5 minute breaks after almost 10 minutes,  seems to want to end lectures early, etc. Major assignments (including a huge quiz) have gone weeks without being graded. It's clear he's a smart guy, and if you ask him direct questions he'll be extremely helpful, but otherwise, prepare for a very hands-off professor. I've been mainly teaching myself the 472 material with Google so far."
