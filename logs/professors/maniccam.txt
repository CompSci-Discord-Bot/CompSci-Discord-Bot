Student Ratings for Suchindran Maniccam:

"Teaches well but can be rude towards his students"

"For 341: C, C++, Lisp, Python, compiler, and the basic history of programming languages. Doesn't like canvas, but will upload files to it. Emails you your grade. Can be rude, but teaches well. Cams are required to be on. Not given a lot of time to do quizzes."

"Look I am going to be really honest here. Manny is an excellent teacher when it comes to teaching stuff except that he has a bit of temper. He can be hard to reason with. I took 314 with him and whatever he explained in the class actually made sense. He can be harsh when it comes to quizzes, but arenâ€™t all professors the same? If you show up to all of his classes and ask questions, you should be good in 314!"
