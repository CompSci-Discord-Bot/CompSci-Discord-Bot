Student Ratings for Aby Tehranipour: 


"I had Aby for 111, which was an easy class, so perhaps take these comments with a grain of salt. I never found anything particularly wrong with Aby. He gets straight to the point with his teaching and doesn't go off on tangents, which makes learning from him rather easy. Some may think he gets irritated when you ask for help, but personally I don't think he minds helping and that's just simply his natural demeanor. I didn't struggle very hard with his exams, but like I said, it was 111 when I had him. I would consider Aby to be one of the better CompSci professors, and I would take him again if I had the opportunity."
