Student Ratings for Zenia Bahorski: 


"Dr. Zenia Bahorski is a very enthusiastic teacher and clearly loves teaching programming! COSC111 is my first ever programming class, and I never knew a single thing about programming before this class. I like Dr. Bahorskiâ€™s teaching methods. She has us read the chapters and work through the programs in the chapters each week and then has very well prepared lectures. She is a little slow/sloppy at typing so it can take a while for her to lay out code but she is brilliant and knows Java extremely well! I chose Dr. Bahorski because of her having the highest rating on rate my professor and most of the reviews there are pretty accurate."

"You ever love her, or you hate her. Despite her flaws, I didn't mind Zenia all that much. I took 231 with her. Coming from someone who had prior HTML/CSS knowledge before taking the class, I wouldn't say her teaching style was very beginner friendly, as for the first few weeks I was relying on my prior knowledge rather than her lectures. Her lectures felt very quickly thrown together and there were times where it felt like she wasn't sure what she was doing. She spent a lot of time on easy stuff like HTML and CSS, but the harder stuff like JavaScript and PHP didn't go beyond roughly a week, if my memory serves me well. The vibe she gives off overall is honestly hard to describe. She's one of those professors where you'll have a good or bad experience depending on who you are. So in other words, take her, don't take her, best of luck to you either way."
