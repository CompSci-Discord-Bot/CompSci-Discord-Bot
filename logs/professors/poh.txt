Student Ratings for Elsa Poh: 

"Elsa Poh is engaging but she is quite fast-paced. She has not used lockdown browser for my class, but did require webcams on and requires a good amount of written(scanned) assignments. Grading is pretty strict and you have to be very specific when you ask her things. She is very responsive on email though!"
