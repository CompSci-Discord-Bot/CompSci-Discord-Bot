Student Ratings for Siyuan Jiang: 

"She has a really laid back class style, very easygoing and overall good with complex topics.  Honest, gives a lot of extra credit."

"Prof. Jiang is a blast to have as a professor. She's always enthusiastic during lectures, and even has us doing a short \"get to know you\" activity at the beginning of each session. She is also very eager to help if anyone has a problem, and is not shy about letting someone share their screen during class in order to help them out. One thing I wish she would do is provide us with a textbook or some other pre-prepared material, as step-by-step documentation of each activity would be super helpful because she tends to go very quickly during class. Not a big deal though, because her lectures are recorded, and everything you do in 381 can be easily researched on Google. Overall, solid professor with a very kind demeanor."

"Professor Jiang is a great person, knowledgeable, and she's good at what she does. What more could you ask for? She's always willing to help and gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit. She really helps take the stress out of the more intimidating courses in the CompSci program. Her workload and her due dates are reasonable. Her exams aren't as bad as others. I took 381 with her, and I plan to take her again for the senior project (481W). The only criticism I can give is that sometimes she's a little hard to understand and she can go a little fast. Other than that, solid professor, 10/10 recommend üëç"
