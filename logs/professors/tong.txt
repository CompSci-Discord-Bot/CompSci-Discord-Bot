Student Ratings for Weitian Tong: 

"Tong his explanations make a lot of sense, he is very organized and detail-oriented"

"He's a nice guy, but his classes are hard."

"is a very structured professor, you always know what material will be on quizzes and tests (although sometimes the wording can be confusing).  He is very open to feedback and gives a lot of resources, while the class itself is mostly drawing on a power point.  He can be hard to follow at times, but overall he's not bad if you pay attention."
